# Flutter Android Builder Docker Image

A ready-to-use Docker image for building Flutter Android apps. This image contains everything you need to build APKs and AABs without installing Flutter, Java, or Android SDK manually on your machine.

## Features

- Flutter SDK: 3.35.1 (stable channel by default)
- Java: OpenJDK 17
- Android SDK: Platforms 31, 33, 34
- NDK: 27.0.12077973
- CMake: 3.22.1
- Build Tools: 33.0.2
- Pre-cached Gradle & Flutter dependencies for faster builds

All SDKs and tools are installed and pre-configured. Just mount your Flutter project and start building.

## Updating Flutter

Flutter releases new versions frequently. You can build a new Docker image with a newer Flutter version by changing the FLUTTER_VERSION build argument:

```text
docker build \
  --build-arg FLUTTER_VERSION=3.50.0 \
  -t ghcr.io/jebstern/flutter-android-builder:3.50.0-ndk27-api31-34 .
docker push ghcr.io/jebstern/flutter-android-builder:3.50.0-ndk27-api31-34
```

This way, the Flutter version is visible in the image tag, making it easier to track which version is used in your CI/CD pipelines.
